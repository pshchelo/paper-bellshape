  abstract = {Liposome formation and lipid swelling on platinum electrodes in distilled
	water and water solutions in d.c. electrical fields have been investigated
	for different amounts of a negatively charged lipid (mixture from
	71% PC, 21.5% PE and 7.5% PS), and a neutral lipid (DMPC). Negatively
	charged lipids do not form liposomes without field when the thickness
	of the dried lipid layer is of the order or less than that corresponding
	to 90 bilayers. The rate and extent of swelling of layers thicker
	than 90 bilayers is largest on the cathode, smaller without fields
	and smallest on the anode. The theory, based on the assumption that
	osmotic and electrostatic forces drive lipid swelling and liposome
	formation, is in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental
	data; in particular, it gives the observed linear dependence of the
	rate of swelling on the inverse lipid layer thickness. To induce
	liposome formation for layers thinner than 90 bilayers it was necessary
	to apply a negative potential which is proportional to the logarithm
	of the inversed layer thickness. The characteristic critical potential
	is proportional to RTk/F; R being the gas constant, Tk the absolute
	temperature and F the Faraday constant. This indicates that redistribution
	of counterions may be the cause which increases the repulsive electrostatic
	intermembrane forces to overcome van der Waals attraction. For thicknesses
	below 10 bilayers, formation of very thin-walled liposomes of narrow
	size distribution and mean diameter of the order of 30 m was observed.
	These liposomes grow in size before detachment and a formula for
	the kinetics of growth has been derived, which is in very good agreement
	with the experimental data. The effects of d.c. fields on DMPC swelling
	are smaller and lead to formation of liposome-like structures of
	different appearence. Bilayer separation and bending are prerequisites
	for liposome formation from hydrating lipids. Therefore, a possible
	molecular mechanism is that membranes should be destabilized to bend
	and fuse to form liposomes. This requires the right proportion between
	structured regions, in the form of bilayers, and defects and/or non-bilayer
	structures, and in many cases external constraints, in particular,
	electrical fields.},

  title = {Settling of a vesicle in the limit of quasispherical shapes},
  journal = {Journal of Fluid Mechanics},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {690},
  pages = {227-261},
  number = { },
  abstract = { ABSTRACT Vesicles are drops of radius of a few tens of micrometres
	bounded by an impermeable lipid membrane of approximately 4 nm thickness
	in a viscous fluid. The salient characteristics of such a deformable
	object are a membrane rigidity governed by flexion due to curvature
	energy and a two-dimensional membrane fluidity characterized by a
	local membrane incompressibility. This provides unique properties
	with strong constraints on the internal volume and membrane area.
	Yet, when subjected to external stresses, vesicles exhibit a large
	deformability. The deformation of a settling vesicle in an infinite
	flow is studied theoretically, assuming a quasispherical shape and
	expanding all variables of the problem onto spherical harmonics.
	The contribution of thermal fluctuations is neglected in this analysis.
	A system of equations describing the temporal evolution of the shape
	is derived with this formalism. The final shape and the settling
	velocity are then determined and depend on two dimensionless parameters:
	the Bond number and the excess area. This simultaneous study leads
	to three stationary shapes, an egg-like shape already observed in
	an analogous experimental configuration in the limit of weak flow
	magnitude (Chatkaew, Georgelin, Jaeger & Leonetti, Phys. Rev. Lett,
	2009, vol. 103(24), 248103), a parachute-like shape and a non-trivial
	non-axisymmetrical shape. The final shape depends on the initial
	conditions: prolate or oblate vesicle and orientation compared with
	gravity. The analytical solution in the small deformation regime
	is compared with numerical results obtained with a three-dimensional
	code. A very good agreement between numerical and theoretical results
	is found. },

  journal = {New Journal of Physics},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {13},
  pages = {035026},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {We study the sedimentation of buoyant giant lipid vesicles in a quiescent
	fluid at velocities ranging from 5 to 20 Î¼m s â1 . Floppy vesicles
	are deformed by the flow. Their bottom (upstream) part remains spherical,
	while their top (downstream) part narrows down and elongates along
	the direction of motion, resulting in pear-like shapes or in the
	reversible formation of a micron-size tube at the vesicle top. The
	sedimentation velocity of a vesicle is very similar to that of a
	rigid sphere. Using a thermodynamic approach, we show that the hydrodynamic
	force acting at the top of a floppy vesicle can exceed the critical
	force needed to draw a membrane tube. We predict that the tube radius
	scales as the power 1/3 of the ratio of the bending energy to the
	typical hydrodynamic stress, Î· U/R , where Î· is the fluid viscosity,
	U the sedimentation velocity and R the vesicle radius. This result
	is consistent with the previously reported experimental data. The
	tensions of vesicles exhibiting a tube and of pear-like shape are
	deduced from the thermodynamic approach.},

  journal = {New Journal of Physics},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {13},

  abstract = {The fusion peptide (FP) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
	is part of the N-terminus of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp41
	and is believed to play an important role in the viral entry process.
	To understand the immediate effect of this peptide on the cell membrane,
	we have studied the influence of the synthetic FP sequence FP23 on
	the mechanical properties of model lipid bilayers. For this purpose,
	giant unilamellar vesicles were prepared from the unsaturated lipid
	dioleoylphosphatidylcholine mixed in various molar ratios with FP23.
	The bending stiffness of the vesicles was measured with two different
	methods: fluctuation analysis and aspiration with micropipettes.
	The data obtained from both of these approaches show that the bending
	stiffness of the membrane decreases gradually with increasing concentration
	of the FP23 in the bilayer. Low concentrations of only a few mol%
	FP23 are sufficient to decrease the bending stiffness of the lipid
	bilayer by about a factor of 2. Finally, data obtained for the stretching
	elasticity modulus of the membrane suggest that the peptide insertion
	decreases the coupling between the two leaflets of the bilayer.},
